### Founders & Coders

#### Full-Stack JavaScript Development Course (June - October 2017)

Founders & Coders is a brilliant co-operative that runs a peer-led and project-based coding bootcamp. The course covers test-driven development using a full JavaScript stack (JavaScript and Node.js) with relational databases, plus aspects of design and project management, agile methodologies and pair programming.

Once the course is over, I will help to mentor the next students at F&C as well as create learning materials to improve the curriculum.

### Warp Music Publishing

#### Copyright Manager (February 2015 - June 2017)

Music publishers can be thought of as record labels for songwriters. At Warp Publishing (sister company to Warp Records), I managed the following:

* Looked after the compositional rights of writers' works and ensured that they are registered correctly globally at collection societies and digital platforms such as YouTube.
* Resolved counter and duplicate claims, tracked and analysed global income and fixed discrepancies at collection societies, digital service providers and sub-publishers to ensure our writers got full royalty payments.

### Compass Coffee

#### Co-Owner & Manager (January 2014 - March 2017)

I co-founded a zero-waste-to-landfill cafe that operates out of the pirate ship home of the Hackney Pirates, an educational charity based in East London.
* Co-managed all aspects of the business: daily operations, finances, suppliers, menu design, marketing, employee hire and management, data analysis and much more.
* Organised and delivered high profile catering events.
